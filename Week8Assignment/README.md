#  DJ App for Beginners: Research
This project is where I'm going to start exploring my final project for Mobile App Development Lab. I'm working with a 3D Model of the Pioneer DDJ Flx 4 and also attempting to create my own modular board. This is the first experimentation I'll be doing. The final product should have multiple ways to learn the different facets of DJing. 

This is a design engineering project, and I'll be using Figma and XCode to make it a reality in May 2025. Based on several rounds of experimentation and playtesting, I'll create the final set of methods to learn DJing for beginners.

This is the survey I made for user research: https://forms.gle/Mq5uEKJ8LGXq5Yz76
