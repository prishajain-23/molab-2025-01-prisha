# Plan
Make an app that creates an audio-reactive visualization using basic animation.

1. take photos from your phone
2. hear the sounds the photo makes 
    *started by using average background color sketch by Brandon Baars*
    *eventually moved to using pixel sorting to extract 3 most prominent colors in image*
4. circular audio-visualizer using FFT
    *i started with a regular sine wave (check WaveformView)*
5. drag photo around to change audio effects -> explore more than just reverb and delay -> maybe we do panning ðŸ’¯
    *we did do panningðŸ’¯*

Goals:
- Learn MIDI notes and timing using AudioKit
- Practice animation

What I actually did:
- Learned how to start out with FFT analysis using AudioKit
- Learned how to do pixel sorting and image handling
