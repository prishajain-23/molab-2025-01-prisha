#  EQ filters + different users
This app allows users to load local files from their phones and adjust the high-pass and low-pass filters to do real-time audio manipulation and experimentation to music.

Using a Firebase backend, users are able to save filter settings from different user ids.

## Things that don't work
- usernames don't save- i think they're not actually being stored in Firebase
- loading "default music" i.e. the files in this project isn't working

## Summary generated by GPT:

This is a modular DJ-style iOS app built using SwiftUI 5.9, AudioKit, and Firebase Firestore. It allows users to load audio files, adjust EQ filters, and save per-user EQ settings.

### What the App Does

- Users can select or create a **username** to identify themselves
- Users can load audio files from:
  - The system Files app
  - A pre-bundled `Music/` folder included in the app
- Each track can be played and manipulated using:
  - High-pass filter
  - Low-pass filter
- Users can save their EQ settings to Firestore, which are restored when that file is reloaded
- All EQ data is stored under the selected username for personal or shared use

### Key Technologies

- **SwiftUI 5.9**: UI and data flow
- **AudioKit**: Audio engine, filters, and playback
- **Firebase Firestore**: Stores EQ settings tied to usernames
- **UIDocumentPicker**: Lets users load local audio files
- **@Observable / @Bindable**: Swiftâ€™s latest data binding model

### Code Overview

- `TrackView`: Main UI for playback, EQ control, and file/user selection
- `AudioManager`: Singleton that runs the audio engine and applies filters
- `AudioFilePicker`: Opens system Files app for importing audio
- `DefaultMusicPicker`: Lists bundled audio files inside the app
- `UserSelectView`: Allows user to select or create a username
- `UserSessionManager`: Tracks the current username in use
- `FirebaseAudioStorage`: Reads/writes EQ settings to Firestore
- `EQSettings`: Model used to serialize EQ settings to Firebase

### How It's Organized

This app separates logic by domain:
- UI views = in SwiftUI files
- Audio processing = in `AudioManager`
- Firebase logic = in `FirebaseAudioStorage`
- User identity = in `UserSessionManager`
